# JuggleBall

It's like Breakout, but without the bricks. And the number of balls increases over time.

Made for [Weekly Game Jam, Week 18 on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-18)

Move the cursor to move the paddle. To increase the force applied on the ball on impact, move the cursor up. The higher the cursor when the ball hits the paddle, the 
higher the ball will bounce.

Each time the ball bounces, your score increases. You get more points per bounce if:
- The ball had longer airtime
- There are more balls onscreen at the same time

You lose if you drop all the balls that are currently in existence, or after you drop a total of 20 balls. Click or press any key to restart.
